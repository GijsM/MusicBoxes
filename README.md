# Devathon Project
This is my submission to the Devathon Project, ign: 504Errors

## About

This project is all about music. in fact, making your own music. Craft your very own Music Box© and create music alone, or with your friends.

MAKE SURE YOUR MUSIC IS ON IN SETTINGS
This plugin works with the Music slider in the settings, not noteblocks & music


## Theme

The theme for the 2016 Devathon Contest is: **Machines!**
Make a machine, make an interaction with a machine, or do something completely creative! As long as it has something to do with machines, you're good to go.

## Crafting

To craft a Music Box©, simply surround a diamond with note blocks in your crafting grid, and there you have it!

## Making your own music

to get started, right click on the Music Box© once you have placed it and select an instrument. After that you can start clicking the glass.
The music goes down from above and the notes on your right are the highest. Click on the Nether Star to add extra pages of music
Once you are finished, turn it on in the main menu, and tweak the speed.

There you have it! add more instruments to give it a bit more feel.

## Redstone

You can also power them with redstone, so you have automated control over the music.

## Removing them

Simply punch the music box in either creative or surival and the item will pop up so you can replace it.

## Saving them

Music Boxes© don't need to be saved, they do this automatically on stop

## Video
